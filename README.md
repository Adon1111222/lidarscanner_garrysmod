# Lidar Scanner Garry's Mod
A small Garry's Mod project which implements the LIDAR Scanner function.
## Build
If you want to build from source code, you need to compress the code using minifycode in a folder or other application.
This will keep the file size to a minimum. Also, game should launch it without minify.
